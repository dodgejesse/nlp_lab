Rules for annotating dependencies:
When the word 'de' is used as a preposition to modify an adjective with a noun, we will consider 'de' to be the dependent of the corresponding adjective.
The past participle will be the head of the auxiliary verb.
For reflexive verbs, stressed participle should be a child of the verb itself.
For indirect and direct pronouns, the pronoun is a child of the verb.
For 'ne pas', we will have 'pas' a child of 'ne', and 'ne' a child of the verb. (note, even if there is an auxiliary verb, 'ne' will be the child of the head verb.)
Example: 'ont ete perpe^tre^s', both 'ont' and 'ete' are children of the head verb.
'That' is a child of the head verb in sentences like 'we learned that something happened.' learned is parent of 'that'.
Transitions like 'en revange' are children of the head verb directly. 
Idiomatic phrases like 'tout a fait', tout <- fait, a <- fait.
'jour_1 apres_2 jour_3': jour_1 <- apres_2, jour_1 <- jour_3.
Idiomatic phrases: 'est d' accord': d' <- accord, est 
For names, first name is child of last name.
Il y a: Il <- a, y <- a.
Conjunctions, such as 'but', (i.e. mais) that have dependent clauses, they are children of the head verb of that clause. 
When clauses have no semantic meaning and are transitional phrases, the smaller bits are connected to the bigger bits. I.e. 'en effet': en <- effet, where 'en' is the preposition and 'effet' is the noun. Similar to 'tout a fait'.
Conjunctions such as 'et', in 'we went to the store thursday and friday', we have went <- and, went <- thursday, went <- friday. this is true in subordinant clauses as well, where the conjuction and it's arguments go to the head verb of that clause.
in a-t-il 



deja: attaches to the past participle in costructions like 'a deja ete introduite'
when we have 'fait-il verb', where the fait-il makes the sentence a question, we put the fait-il as the head.
for names of directives, we can have the name be the child of 'directive'. such as 'directive 55 / 90 / 45', we have 'directive <- 55', 'directive <- 90', and 'directive <- 45'.

*ne and pas should be children of the verb itself! otherwise we have projective trees. wtf.
